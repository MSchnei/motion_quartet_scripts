The first step in the original pipeline was to create BrainVoyager *.fmr files
from the dicom files.

This step is obsolete here, since dicom files have already been converted by
BrainVoyager and have been made available for download on zenodo:
https://zenodo.org/record/1489227

Data for download were shared in nifti format (not *.fmr file format).
There are (at least) two possible ways to continue from here:
1) BrainVoyager users can load the nifti data in BrainVoyager, which will
internally convert the data to *.fmr (and *.stc) files and continue using the
analysis pipeline provided here.
2) Users of other software packages can use the provided nifti files together
with the stimulus information in the *.tsv files to perform their own analyses.
