The idea is to prepare a quick brain mask for the functional images that can be
used by spm to consider only regions inside the brain to optimize the motion
correction cost function.

This seems to provide (visually) better motion correction compared to the outcome
when no mask is used.

The brain mask may include the cerebellum or not, not a big difference was found
for the two options.

The following steps were followed to obtain the brain mask:

* Create the mean of the functional images of the first run of the respective
  session
* Use itksnap on the mean of the functional images of the first run of the
  respective session
* Use bubble growing algorithm in combination with appropriate intensity
  thresholding
